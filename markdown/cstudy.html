<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Chronos is an event-capturing framework for greenfield applications, and is built using NodeJS, Apache Kafka, TimescaleDB, and PipelineDB. It allows developers to easily capture and store user events on the client side to then perform data exploration in order to aid business logic. By using Apache Kafka, Chronos is a streaming system at its core and is thus easily expandable to the developer&#39;s needs. Further, Chronos is deployed using Docker and comes with a CLI that abstracts the difficulties in installing and running the system.</p>
